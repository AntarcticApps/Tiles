# How to Contribute

If you found a bug, have an idea for Tiles, or just feel like contributing, we would love for you to contribute to Tiles.

If you are interested in fixing a bug or implementing a requested feature, take a look at Github's issues or [Uservoice](http://antarcticapps.uservoice.com/) for ideas.

Once you've found something to work on, simply fork the repo, modify the code as required, and submit a pull request.
