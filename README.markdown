Overview
--------
Tiles is an alternative new tab page that displays all of your favorite websites in a colorful, minimalistic grid of tiles, where each tile has a two-character symbol and a background color that is automatically set from the website's icon.

There is virtually no limit to the amount of tiles you can add. It's really easy to add tiles with a button in the Chrome toolbar. No matter how many tiles you add, you never have to scroll to find the site you want â€“ the tiles grow and shrink as necessary.

Tiles strives to improve both the aesthetic and functionality of the new tab page. Each tile is easily identifiable with its color and two-character symbol, making it really easy to launch your favorite websites even with a large number of tiles. At the same time, all of the tiles are consistent and clean, making your new tab page look beautiful no matter what.
